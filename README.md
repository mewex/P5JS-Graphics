README for Advanced p5.js Assignments - Series A3
Overview
This repository is part of a series of advanced p5.js programming assignments, focusing on subclass creation, image manipulation, and interactive text animation. The assignments are designed to enhance understanding of object-oriented programming concepts within the p5.js framework and to encourage creative approaches to visual programming.

Assignments List
A3-01: Mosaic Image Subclass
Objective: Create a subclass of p5.Image that implements a mosaic(int blockSize) method.

Description:

The mosaic(int blockSize) method applies a mosaic effect to an image, where blockSize specifies the size of each mosaic block (e.g., 4x4 pixels).
The method replaces each block of pixels in the image with the average color value of the pixels in that block.
Demonstrate the functionality by drawing an image with several different block sizes.
A3-02: Kinetic Text App
Objective: Write an application that demonstrates kinetic (moving) text.

Description:

The app should allow the user to type text and interactively move the text around as they type.
Possible interactions include drifting words or letters, bending lines, or fluttering text to the bottom of the screen.
The app should be unique and not a direct copy of existing examples, though such examples may be used for inspiration and as a starting point.
Installation
